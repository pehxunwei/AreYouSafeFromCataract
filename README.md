# AreYouSafeFromCataract
Deep Learning Developer: Jump Start by RedDragon.AI

# Introduction
This project aims to create an image classifier neural network through transfer-learning and InceptionV3 for classification of whether a person has cataract or not. This project is the final submission for Deep Learning Developer: Jump Start January 01 Workshop. The dataset is created by using Google images of cataract and Fatkun (an image batch download extension).

# Conclusion
The image classifer is able to predict confidently (with a result of 0.94) whether the person contracts cataract by image of his or her eye.

However, if the eye is half-closed or is glossy because of the light reflection, the neural network will diagnose the patient with cataract.
